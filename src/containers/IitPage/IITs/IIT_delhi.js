                                                        The inception of the concept of <b>IITs</b> traces back to a 1945 report presented by Sh. N.M. Sircar,
                                                        who was then a member of Education on the Viceroy's Executive Council. This report paved the way
                                                        for the establishment of the first <b>Indian Institute of Technology</b> in <b>Kharagpur</b> in 1950. Shri
                                                        Sircar's recommendations extended to the notion of diversifying these Institutes across various
                                                        regions of the nation. The Indian Government, embracing these suggestions from the Sircar
                                                        Committee, embarked on establishing additional <b>Institutes of Technology</b> through collaborations
                                                        with supportive countries. The initial offer of assistance emanated from the <b>USSR</b>, which agreed to
                                                        collaborate via <b>UNESCO</b> to set up an Institute in <b>Bombay</b>. Subsequently, <b>Institutes of Technology</b>
                                                        were established in <b>Madras, Kanpur, and Delhi</b> through partnerships with <b>West Germany, the USA, and
                                                            the UK</b> respectively. The timeline of <b>IIT</b> growth includes the establishment of the <b>Indian Institute
                                                                of Technology, Guwahati</b> in 1995 and the conversion of the <b>University of Roorkee</b> into an <b>IIT</b> in
                                                        2001.<br /><br />

                                                        An intergovernmental dialogue between the <b>Government of India</b> and the <b>British Government</b> initiated
                                                        a collaboration to establish an Institute of Technology in <b>Delhi</b>. While the British Government
                                                        expressed a preliminary inclination towards a modest beginning, it endorsed the establishment of a

                                                        establishment of the <b>Delhi Engineering College Trust</b>, supported by the UK Government and the
                                                        Federation of British Industries in London. In a significant symbolic gesture, <b>H.R.H. Prince

                                                        of Governors. The Board functions through its Standing Committees - Finance Committee, Building &
